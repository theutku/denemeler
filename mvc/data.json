He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the US; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one                       album.</p><p>The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.</p>",

        "detail": "<p>In the mid-1960s Clapton left the Yardbirds to play blues with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Immediately after leaving Mayall, Clapton formed the power trio Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce, in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and                'arty, blues-based psychedelic pop'. Furthermore, he formed blues rock band Blind Faith with Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech.</p><p>For most of the 1970s Clapton's output bore the influence of the mellow style of JJ Cale and the reggae of Bob Marley. His version of Marley's              'I Shot the Sheriff' helped reggae reach a mass market. Two of his most popular recordings were 'Layla', recorded with Derek and the Dominos; and Robert Johnson's 'Crossroads', recorded with Cream. Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Clapton's grief was expressed in                the song 'Tears in Heaven', which was featured on his Unplugged album.</p>",
